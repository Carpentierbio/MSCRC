# MSCRC

The MSCRC framework gathers the codes that have been used to study the integration of three omics data (mRNA expression, microRNA expression, and DNA methylation data) using [sparse mCCA](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.2202/1544-6115.1470/html) to classify colorectal cancer samples.

A multi-omics classifier was trained and is available for prediction with [MSCRCclassifier](https://github.com/Carpentierbio/MSCRCclassifier) R package.
